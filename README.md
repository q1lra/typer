Automation tool that injects randomized, human-like keystrokes into background windows to bypass detection without needing window focus

-----

## Architecture

### Background Injection

The system targets specific UI controls or top-level window handles using the `ControlSend` API. This allows for direct message queue injection, meaning the target application receives keystrokes even while minimized or out of focus.

### Anti-Detection Engine

A dynamic jitter algorithm applies random variance to base delays. It specifically recognizes whitespace characters to insert secondary micro-pauses (30ms–70ms), accurately replicating human typing rhythms to bypass behavioral analysis.

### Conditional Persistence

Settings are managed via a localized `.ini` handler. To ensure a zero-footprint installation, the configuration file is only generated if the user enters valid text, keeping your project directory clean.

### Execution Control

The utility runs on a state-aware loop, allowing for real-time pausing, resuming, or an emergency reload to terminate the input thread instantly.
